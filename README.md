# SampleMapData

A collection of map data that I use in some samples. I primarily use this a simple way to host sample data on a third party endpoint for demo purposes. Much of the data in this project is rehosted from other GitHub projects and the web. The reason for doing this is to ensure that I have control over the security of the data.

All data licenses and copyrights remain unchanged from the original author/data owner.
